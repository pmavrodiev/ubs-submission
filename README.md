# UBS Data Science Task


You can find two input files in the `data/` folder - `data.csv` and `target.csv`. Each row in `data.csv` belongs to a measurement and each column represents a feature. For each row in `data.csv` you have a corresponding class label in `target.csv`. You can consider the row-numbers as keys.

## Task 1
Define and train a set of possible classifiers and show which one performs best. Watch out not to overfit.

## Task 2
Try to reduce the number of features. In the dataset you have over 100 features. Find the good ones for your classifier.

# Submission

In addition to solving the two tasks above we ask you to create a short presentation (not more than 10 slides) outlining your approach, analysis, results and challenges encounted. We will then use the presentation as a starting point during our final discussion.

Please add all documents related to your submission (source files, presentation files, etc.) to the `solution/` folder. You can push directly into this repository, however, if you choose to create a pull request, that would also be fine.

**Note**: Your submission will be judged on a compound evaluation of your approach, code quality and results. Note that for open-ended tasks we give much more weight to a well-justified approach, rather than to complete results.
