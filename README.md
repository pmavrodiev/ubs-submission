# UBS Data Science Task


You can find two input files in the `data/` folder - `data.csv` and `target.csv`. Each row in `data.csv` belongs to a measurement and each column represents a feature. For each row in `data.csv` you have a corresponding class label in `target.csv`. You can consider the row-numbers as keys.

## Task 1
Define a set of possible classifiers and show which one performs best. Watch out not to overfit.

## Task 2
Try to reduce the number of features. In the dataset you have over 100 features. Find the good ones for your classifier.

**Note**: Your submission will be judged on a compound evaluation of your approach, code quality and results. Note that for open-ended tasks we give much more weight to a well-justified approach, rather than to complete results.
